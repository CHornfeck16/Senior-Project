# PantryPro: Simplifying Food Inventory Management for Pantries
## Project Description:
  PantryPro is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline food inventory management for pantries, providing users with an intuitive interface to track, manage, and optimize their pantry contents. Developed as a senior project by Christopher Hornfeck, PantryPro combines database management with front-end web development to create a user-friendly application that simplifies the process of managing food storage and grocery shopping.

## Problem Statement:
  Managing food inventory in household pantries is often disorganized and inefficient, leading to the risk of food waste from expired items and difficulties in restocking essentials. Existing methods lack automation for tracking expiration dates and generating grocery lists, making it challenging for users to stay organized and minimize waste. A simple, user-friendly solution is needed to streamline pantry management, provide timely alerts for expiring items, and facilitate easy grocery list creation based on current inventory. This project seeks to address these issues by developing PantryPro, a user-centric application designed to simplify food inventory management and optimize the grocery shopping experience.

## Key Features:
### 1. Database for Food Storage:
  PantryPro features a robust database system that allows users to store detailed information about the food items in their pantry. Users can input data such as item name, quantity, expiration date, and category or location within the pantry.

### 2. Front-End App Using React:
  The user interface of PantryPro is built using React, providing a responsive and interactive experience for users. The app allows users to easily navigate through their pantry inventory, add new items, and view alerts and recommendations.

### 3. Entering Food Information: 
  Users can quickly and conveniently add new food items to their pantry through the PantryPro app. Whether scanning barcodes or manually entering information, adding items is straightforward and efficient.

### 4. Expiration Date Alerts:
  PantryPro includes a built-in alert system that notifies users when food items are approaching their expiration dates. These alerts help users minimize food waste by prompting them to use or discard items before they spoil.

### 5. Automatic Grocery List Generation:
  One of PantryPro's standout features is its ability to automatically generate grocery lists based on the contents of the user's pantry. By analyzing existing inventory and identifying items that need restocking, PantryPro simplifies the shopping process and ensures users always have essential items on hand.

## Benefits: 
### Efficiency:
  PantryPro saves users time and effort by providing a centralized platform for managing pantry inventory and shopping lists.
  
### Minimized Food Waste:
  With expiration date alerts and automatic grocery list generation, PantryPro helps users minimize food waste and optimize their food consumption.
  
### User-Friendly Interface:
  The intuitive design of the PantryPro app makes it easy for users to navigate and utilize its features, even for those with limited technical expertise.
